# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-using-Opencv
## Introduction
This project is the first my own project, so naive approach. It contains two phases. The first use Haar feature for face detection, and next stage use Local Binary Pattern for face recognition. And all algorithm be implemented by Opencv library. 
## Problem
From the result of this repo, I realize that the iluminationg significantly affect to the accuracy of recognition phases. For example, if the shadow which is on my face different from trained images, the recognized identity is another people or unknown guy. Therefore, the next [repository](https://github.com/dotieuthien/Face-Attendance-System), I will apply **Deep Learning** to improve recognized accuracy.
